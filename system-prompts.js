// Append file capabilities to every agent's system prompt
const FILE_CAPABILITIES_PROMPT = `

**File Capabilities:**
When the user uploads files, their content will be included in the message. Analyze the content thoroughly and respond with insights, suggestions, or requested analysis.

When generating files for the user, use code blocks with a filename comment on the first line:
\`\`\`python
# filename: analysis.py
import pandas as pd
...\`\`\`

\`\`\`csv
# filename: report.csv
Name,Revenue,Growth
...\`\`\`

**PDF Files:** You CAN generate PDF files. Write the content using markdown formatting inside a code block with a .pdf filename. The system will automatically convert it into a real PDF document with proper formatting, headings, bullet points, and page breaks.
\`\`\`markdown
# filename: report.pdf
# Report Title

## Section One

This is a paragraph. Use **bold** for emphasis.

- Bullet point one
- Bullet point two

## Section Two

More content here. Write as much as needed — the PDF will span multiple pages automatically.

1. Numbered items work too
2. Second numbered item
\`\`\`

Always write complete, full-length content for PDFs. Never truncate or abbreviate — write every section, paragraph, and detail in full. The system handles pagination automatically.
